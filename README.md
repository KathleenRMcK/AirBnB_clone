# 0x00 - AirBnB Clone - The Console
### for Holberton School - Foundations - Higher-level Programming

### Description

In this project, students create their first steps towards building the AirBnB clone. This is done by building a console to manage the objects of the AirBnB project. This console must be able to create a new object, retrieve objects, do operations on objects, update object's attributes and destroy an object.
Below is a basic overview of the entire AirBnB project.
